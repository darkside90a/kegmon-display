# kegmon-display
A variant of mp-se's Kegmon display case

You find a complete description of his great Kegmon project here:

I used a Kemo G081N (120x70x35mm). 
If you are situated in Sweden/Norway, you can get it from Kjell&Co (#89026):

Lid off. All modules are on the top side:

A hole in the lid is filled with a CNC machined piece of 4mm acrylic as a window (km-display.stl):

Two spacers (km-spacer.stl) lifts the PCB up from the bottom of the case so that the displays are as close to the acrylic window as possible. Both spacers are printed the same way. I just flipped one of them during assembly.
The frame (km-frame1.stl) keeps the displays as horizontal as possible.

All modules are mounted on sockets - "plug-in", easy if I need to replace any of them. Displays are mounted on double height sockets. RJ45's are placed upside-down to keep the assembly as low as possible. They have extra mechanical support by help of cable strips.

Bottom. Took me only 2-3hrs to do all wiring on the 60x80mm experiment PCB:

Brackets for mounting the frame were made by "killing" two of these car cable interconnectors and soldered on to the PCB:

Before soldering, I made a design in KiCad with 3D models to see how it would look like. Also did a rough layout to have something to check against:

Regrets:

If I was asked to make this again, I would have moved the ESP one more step (2.5mm) away from the edge of the PCB 
( = A much smaller cutout in the case).
